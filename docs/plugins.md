# Plugins

MarkMax has its specific plugin design, but tries to support markdown-it plugins **(Experimental)**.

## Supported markdown-it plugin

MarkMax supports markdown-it plugins by the wrapper for them. But we maybe can't support the 100% of them, due to some reasons for MarkMax plugin design.

Here are all reserved keys for the rules as followed:

| Keys        |
| ----------- |
| code_inline |
| code_block  |
| fence       |
| image       |
| hardbreak   |
| softbreak   |
| text        |
| html_block  |
| html_inline |

> If you wanna use the plugin which needs to change the rule of the reserved keys, it would not work.
